 # Weather by Zip Code API

Currency Converter is an API aimed at converting currency values with their current rates, allowing the exchange between BRL, USD, EUR and JPY currencies.
Conversion rates are obtained through an external [Exchange Rates API](https://exchangeratesapi.io/documentation/).
## Installation

To perform the installation, clone the project in a local folder of your choice:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rogeriomaia1/weather-by-zip-code-api.git
```

I suggest using [Spring Tools](https://spring.io/tools) available for free downloading, as the IDE for development.
In the IDE, import the Maven project to start coding.

To run the application it is necessary to navigate to the Dashboard tab and right-click on the CurrencyConverter project, selecting the (Re)start option.
