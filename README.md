 # Weather by Zip Code API

API to obtain information about the weather through zip code or Brazilian location. Data are obtained through two external APIs [Via CEP API] external (https://viacep.com.br/) and [API Advisor](http://apiadvisor.climatempo.com.br/doc/index. html).

## Installation

To perform the installation, clone the project in a local folder of your choice:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/rogeriomaia1/weather-by-zip-code-api.git
```

I suggest using [Spring Tools](https://spring.io/tools) available for free downloading, as the IDE for development.
In the IDE, import the Maven project to start coding.

To run the application it is necessary to navigate to the Dashboard tab and right-click on the WeatherByZipCode project, selecting the (Re)start option.
